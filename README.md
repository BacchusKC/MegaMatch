# [Mega Match](https://bacchuskc.github.io/MegaMatch/)

This is a React App that tests your memory. Click a Robot Master, but don't ever click the same one twice.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Due to the style in which this game was designed to play, it was not made mobile responsive, and so I can only recommend playing it on a full browser. Thanks!
